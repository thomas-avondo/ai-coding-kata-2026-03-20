# AI Coding Kata - Legacy Checkout Refactoring v1.0.0

## Scenario

You inherited a legacy checkout/pricing module.
It works, but it is hard to understand, hard to change, and risky to extend.

The code currently handles:
- customer types
- discounts
- shipping
- taxes
- occasional promotions

The implementation is intentionally poor:
- long conditional chains
- duplicated business rules
- mixed responsibilities
- hidden quirks
- low readability
- poor extensibility

## Objective

Refactor the pricing module so that:
- current behavior is preserved
- the design becomes easier to extend
- a new customer type and a new promotion can be added safely
- the solution remains simple and understandable

## New requirement

Add support for a new customer type: `partner`

Partner rules:
- base discount: 12%
- free shipping when discounted subtotal is at least 15000 cents
- coupon `PARTNER5` adds an extra 5% discount only for partner customers and only when subtotal is at least 12000 cents
- on Black Friday, partner customers get an extra 3% discount instead of the usual 5%

## Constraints

- Preserve existing behavior unless the new requirement explicitly changes it
- Do not rewrite everything from scratch
- Do not add new external libraries
- Do not change the input/output contract
- Do not add more conditional complexity to the main legacy flow
- Add a safety net before making structural changes
- Introduce structure only when justified by the problem
